Using Backtracking and Forward Tracking algorithms in problems:

## I.	Algothrims 8 Queens Problems:
  
## 1.What is?
  
The N Queen is the problem of placing 8 chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. For example, following is a solution for 4 Queen problem.
		 
## 2.	Backtracking:

To solve this problem, we will make use of the Backtracking algorithm. The backtracking algorithm, in general checks all possible configurations and test whether the required result is obtained or not. For thr given problem, we will explore all possible positions the queens can be relatively placed at. The solution will be correct when the number of placed queens = 8.

Input Format - the number 8, which does not need to be read, but we will take an input number for the sake of generalization of the algorithm to an NxN chessboard

Output Format - all matrices that constitute the possible solutions will contain the numbers 0(for empty cell) and 1(for a cell where queen is placed). Hence, the output is a set of binary matrices.

-Permutation

-Sudoku
